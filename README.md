# aws-cognito-hosted-ui-demo

This is a sample code to show case how to retrieve tokens from a Cognito Hosted UI and use them to invoke an API Gateway secured by Cognito.

1. Setup Cognito Hosted UI as described in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-integration.html)
2. Fill-in the `./src/assets/pool-config.js` file with the information from the User Pool you just created:

```
const pool = {
    USER_POOLID: '',
    CLIENTID: '',
    HOSTED_UI: 'https://<domain>.<region>.amazoncognito.com',
    REGION: 'us-east-1',
    ...
}
```

3. Setup the project with the instruction shown below (Project setup)
4. You need to serve the project from an https route as Cognito only accepts HTTPS redirect URL with a FQDN (ie it will not accept https://localhost/ or https://127.0.0.1).
5. Add the https hosting URI followed by `/done` as the `HTTPS_REDIRECT_GW_URI` in the `pool-config.js` file

```
const pool = {
    ...
    HTTPS_REDIRECT_GW_URI: ''
}
```

6. Create a [REST API in API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html) using Cognito authentication

7. Customize the `callApi` method in `.src/views/Code.vue`

```
        callApi: function() {
            var api_gateway_url = 'https://xxxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/demo/';
            axios.get(api_gateway_url, {
                    headers: { 'Authorization' : this.idToken }
            }).then((data) => console.log(data)).catch((err) => console.log(err))

        }
```
